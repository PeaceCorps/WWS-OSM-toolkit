# WWS-OSM-toolkit
To draft out a toolkit for the use of OpenStreetMap by educators via Peace Corp's World Wise Schools program. 

## Introduction

Since 1989, the Paul D. Coverdell World Wise Schools program has enabled Peace Corps Volunteers, host country communities, and American youth to forge profound connections and engage in cross-cultural learning. Volunteers use a variety of tools, including blogs, emails, photos, videos, phone calls and letters to share their experiences with American youth.

Peace Corps is committed to leveraging new technology to facilitate interactions between Americans and our host country communities and has identified OpenStreetMap as an exciting blended learning tool. Contributing data to OpenStreetMap empowers American youth to actively participate in the international development process and provides a unique and comprehensive understanding of our host communities’ human and physical landscapes. Through our World Wise Schools Correspondence Match program, your students will enjoy exciting conversation and learning opportunities with a Peace Corps Volunteer in the field while helping to create a real base map for use in that Volunteer's projects and host community. 

## For Educators: How to Get Involved
Recommended for students in the 6th grade and above


1. Register for Peace Corps’ World Wise Schools Correspondence Match program [here] (https://www.peacecorps.gov/wws/classroom/correspondence/request/). When registering, indicate that you are interested in mapping in the final box of the registration form by writing, "Please match me with a Volunteer in the Mapping Initiative". 


2. The Peace Corps will contact you to introduce you to your matched Peace Corps Volunteer in the field. We will match you with a Volunteer who is currently working on a mapping project with his or her community.


3. Connect with your Peace Corps Volunteer to coordinate the appropriate type and amount of communication between them and your classroom.


4. Register your students or, if they have their own email addresses, have students register themselves for accounts at [OpenStreetMap] (www.openstreetmap.org). 


5. To learn the basics of “Why” and “How” to map, watch [these videos] (www.mapgive.state.gov) prepared by Peace Corps’ partner organization, Mapgive. The interactive videos provide time for students to practice each step of mapping, so be sure to watch the videos next to computers while logged in to OpenStreetMap. You can also use the pre-existing OpenStreetMap curriculum developed by [TeachOSM] (http://teachosm.org/). 


6. Work with your Peace Corps Volunteer to identify a mapping task that your students can complete. For examples of these tasks, visit Peace Corps' [current list of mapping tasks] (http://tasks.hotosm.org/?sort_by=priority&direction=asc&search=peace+corps). 


7. Start mapping! Your Peace Corps Volunteer and his or her community will need help creating a map of their community, and your students are perfect for the job. They will have the opportunity to observe, analyze, and digitize satellite imagery for a Peace Corps community. Your Peace Corps Volunteer can provide context and a rich description of his or her project during correspondence with your students.
