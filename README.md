[OpenStreetMap] (https://www.openstreetmap.org) empowers American youth to actively participate in international development projects, providing a unique and comprehensive understanding of human and physical landscapes in the countries where we serve. Through our World Wise Schools Correspondence Match program, your students can work with a Peace Corps Volunteer in the field while helping to create a real base map for use in that Volunteer's projects and host community. 

The majority of people in the developing world lack access to accurate, detailed maps of their communities and countries, which poses challenges when attempting to meet basic human needs. For example, health centers need to understand the geographic element of a disease, or an ecotourism business wants to promote environmentally friendly travel on a website. It prevents local governments from accessing data that could help them better allocate resources, and it leaves students without a clear understanding of how to understand their immediate world through a geographic lens. If you are interested in being involved in a digital mapping project, follow the instructions below!

## For Educators: How to Get Involved
Recommended for students in the 6th grade and above

**1. Join Peace Corps' World Wise Schools Correspondence Match.** [Register] (https://www.peacecorps.gov/wws/classroom/correspondence/request/) for Peace Corps’ World Wise Schools Correspondence Match program. Choose "Digital Mapping" from the "Areas of work" drop down menu. If you are already matched with a PCV, ask your volunteer if (s)he is interested in digital mapping.

**2. Collaborate with a Peace Corps Volunteer in the field.** The Peace Corps match you with a Volunteer who is currently working on a mapping project or interested in starting one. Connect with your Peace Corps Volunteer to coordinate communication with your classroom.

**3. Teach your students about digital mapping.** Register your students or, if they have their own email addresses, have students register themselves for accounts at [OpenStreetMap] (www.openstreetmap.org). To learn the basics of “Why” and “How” to map, watch [these videos] (www.mapgive.state.gov) prepared by Peace Corps’ partner organization, Mapgive. The interactive videos provide time for students to practice, so be sure to watch the videos next to computers while logged in to OpenStreetMap. You can also use the pre-existing OpenStreetMap curriculum developed by [TeachOSM] (http://teachosm.org/).

**4. Create a base map of a Peace Corps community for use in a real field project.** Your Peace Corps Volunteer and his or her community will need help creating a map of their community, and your students are perfect for the job. They will have the opportunity to observe, analyze, and digitize satellite imagery for a Peace Corps community. Work with your PCV to provide context and a rich description of the project and mapping tasks that your students should complete. For examples of these tasks, visit Peace Corps' [current list of mapping tasks] (http://tasks.hotosm.org/?sort_by=priority&direction=asc&search=peace+corps).

## For Peace Corps Volunteers: How to Get Involved
Students are an excellent resource when you're working with counterparts to develop a base map of your community on [OpenStreetMap] (https://www.openstreetmap.org). If you lack reliable Internet access or simply the time to create a base map, let American students help you by tracing over roads and buildings in your community. Once they are finished, you and your community will be able to refine the map and add your local knowledge through OpenStreetMap's easy, user-friendly iD map editor. You can also contribute to Peace Corps' Third Goal by communicating with the students who map your community and helping them make sense of the satellite imagery they observe.

**1. Join Peace Corps' World Wise Schools Correspondence Match Program.** [Register] (https://www.peacecorps.gov/wws/volunteers/correspondence/enroll/) for Peace Corps’ World Wise Schools Correspondence Match program. Write "I am interested in Digital Mapping" in the "How did you learn about this program?" box on the form. WWS will connect you with an educator, or you can work with a teacher from the U.S. you know - just include his or her name and email  on the resgistration form.

**2. Collaborate with an American educator and classroom.** The Peace Corps will connect you with a teacher interested in digital mapping. Connect with the educator to coordinate communication with the classroom.

**3. Bring your project to life for students.** Share stories, pictures and rich descriptions of the geography of your community to help students make a connection between the satellite imagery they observe of your site and the humans who live there. PCVs have used a variety of media to communicate with their matched classrooms, including video chats, blog posts, captioned pictures, phone calls, and letters. If you need additional assistance planning your Correspondence Match activities, refer to the [Correspondence Match Handbook] (http://files.peacecorps.gov/uploads/wws/lesson-plans/files/CM_PCV_Handbook_1.pdf) or [WWS Blog] (http://passport.peacecorps.gov/category/world-wise-schools/). 

**4. Measure and report your results.** As with any project, be sure to measure and report your activities and results in the VRF. Take note of how many students participate in your Third Goal activities. You can also ask the teacher to make sure students use a particular hashtag while saving OpenStreetMap edits and check their progress by searching for that hashtag on [Results-Maps.] (http://resultmaps.neis-one.org/osm-changesets#2/34.0/1.4) 

## Pilot Project
WWS and the Office of Innovation at Peace Corps piloted a digital mapping project in Washington, DC and Michigan. Two mappers were featured at the [White House Mapathon.] (http://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2015/06/01/first-annual-white-house-mapathon.cnn) Learn more (link to blog).
